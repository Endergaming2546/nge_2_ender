## Redesigned Folders
Redesigns of the original NGE2 images, models, and such. For use in another project, or if the creator of nge_2_retooling wants to use them instead of the base variants I created. They are a lot less sloppy than the base ones I made (probably going to redo them, particularly the Study images), due to me being able to eliminate some colors and generally being able to make things neater, resizing them, being able to place the pixels myself and not just removing the text using another color, ect.

These images are set up in a way so that they can be extended or retracted as fits the case. I tried to stick within powers of 2, for the sake of the resizing, and also because the original sizes were all over the place.
