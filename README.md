## Base Folders
Files (generally images) with all text removed. Some of the images are touched up minorly, while others I basically just used a paintbrush to paint over because it became too difficult with the huge amount of colors in each image. The most noticable is the Study menus, which was the ones where I did the paintbrushing. From a distance though it should be fine. I may go back to touch these up though and fix them. Further, the least noticable is the buttons, or MenuBase1 for my redesigned files. It is essentially painted over with black, and won't be able to be seen from a distance. Still confused on the transparency at the end of the black, and that would be the only thing noticable (how it blends with the opaque black used), but its unlikely that it would.

Note for the Character Cards: These I am not going to make base variants of due to the clothing and the fact that it isn't necessary, since as far as I can tell the Japanese is just the translation of the name already displayed on the cards. This also applies to every other image that has the english translation already there (scenario folder has a few of thes as far as I am aware).

## Redesigned Folders
Redesigns of the original NGE2 images, models, and such. For use in another project, or if the creator of nge_2_retooling wants to use them instead of the base variants I created. They are a lot less sloppy than the base ones I made (probably going to redo them, particularly the Study images), due to me being able to eliminate some colors and generally being able to make things neater, resizing them, being able to place the pixels myself and not just removing the text using another color, ect.

These images are set up in a way so that they can be extended or retracted as fits the case. I tried to stick within powers of 2, for the sake of the resizing, and also because the original sizes were all over the place.
